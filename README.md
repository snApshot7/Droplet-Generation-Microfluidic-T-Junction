# Droplet-Generation-Microfluidic-T-Junction
Simulated droplet generation in a microfluidic T-junction using VOF in ANSYS &amp; OpenFOAM. Explored laminar multiphase flow of waterâ€“oil, impact of capillary number on droplet breakup, and applications in lab-on-chip, emulsification, and drug delivery systems.
